Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Mostly predictions included more teams, and slightly changed their positions

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 1000 simulations predictions are almost same and there is no big difference
