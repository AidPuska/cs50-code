1. I would write SQL queries to get average energy, danceability and valence to get numbers that on some scale represents someone's aura
2. Maybe, my calculation is not accurate, beacause average may not be best representation of someone's aura. Better calculation would be
to divide them in three categories, with low, middle and high number, and for each number give user one song that describes his aura.
